Linux Distro, Mac OSX and other Unix-like OS Install
================================================================================

Simply move the application file "dmgt" to /usr/local/bin with root permission
and the application should become available while in the terminal much like any
system tool.

Windows Install
================================================================================

Move the application to somewhere on C drive and edit your environment settings
as follows:

1. Right-click on "My Computer" and select "Properties".

2. Click Advanced -> Environment Variables.

3. In the box entitled "System Variables" scroll down to the line that says
   "PATH" and double-click the entry.

4. You will be presented with a dialog box with two text boxes, the bottom text
   box allows you to edit the PATH variable. It is very important that you do
   not delete the existing values in the PATH string, this will cause all sorts
   of problems for you!

5. Scroll to the end of the string and at the end add ";<dmgt-directory>\".
   Here <dmgt-directory> is the full absolute path name of the installation
   directory; eg "C:\dmgt\dir\". Don't forget the semicolon (;) this separates
   the entries in the PATH.

6. Press OK -> OK -> OK and you are done.

Once you have edited your environment settings, dmgt should be accessable from
the Command Prompt like a system tool.

Compile and Install
================================================================================

If you have chosen to compile the application from source a handy make file
should be found within the directory. The following explains:

###~$ make

Build the application. Build flags overridden by:

    make FLAGS="insert flags here"

###~$ make install

**Linux, OSX and other Unix-like OSs only.**

With root premision installs the application to the directory
"/usr/local/bin" making it available in terminal.
Install directory overridden by:

    make PREFIX=/insert/dir/here/ install

###~$ make clean

Removes objects from the directory

###~$ make cleanall

Removes all build files from directory
